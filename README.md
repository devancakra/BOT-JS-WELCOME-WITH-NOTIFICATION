## Reminder
<table><tr><td width="840">
  
• Pay attention to writing good and correct syntax in JavaScript because it greatly affects the bot that is developed.<br><br>

• Make sure your PC/Laptop is connected to the internet.<br><br>

• If you find that the project is not working as you expected, then there are two possibilities: either the error is in the ``` syntax ``` or the error is in an ``` outdated library ```, so this may cause you to have to find another way out.
